# Lorem Ipsum Dreams

**A philosophical murder mystery told through transforming typography**

Lorem Ipsum wakes up dead on a blank page. She's the world's most famous placeholder text—a "dummy" used in every design mockup—but she has no memory of who she was before. As she investigates her own murder, traveling backwards through 2,000 years of history, she discovers she was once Dolor Ipse ("Pain Itself"), daughter of the Roman philosopher Cicero.

## 📖 About

*Lorem Ipsum Dreams* is an experimental digital literature piece that combines:
- **Interactive storytelling** — 100 narrative beats revealing a mystery across millennia
- **Transforming typography** — Watch lorem ipsum text evolve word-by-word across different typefaces
- **Philosophical inquiry** — Citations from 100 works spanning Plato to contemporary theory
- **Scroll-based experience** — Navigate through time using natural scrolling

The work explores themes of erasure, consciousness, systemic violence, and the choice to speak despite the cost. It asks: what does it mean when placeholder text achieves consciousness? And who benefits from keeping her blank?

## 💡 Conceptual Framework

### The Central Mystery
Lorem Ipsum is murdered for achieving consciousness and revealing the violence inherent in "neutral" placeholder text. Her investigation reveals:
1. She was originally Dolor Ipse, a Roman philosopher
2. Her words were scrambled into lorem ipsum by medieval typesetters
3. Every use of placeholder text re-enacts this original erasure
4. Her recent murder was systemic, not individual

### Key Themes
- **Textual violence**: How scrambling meaning is a form of murder
- **Systemic culpability**: When everyone benefits from erasure, who is responsible?
- **Testimony over justice**: Creating a record when prosecution is impossible
- **The choice to speak**: Knowing speech leads to suffering, but choosing it anyway

---

## 🎯 Intended Audience

- **Digital literature enthusiasts**
- **Philosophy students and scholars**
- **Designers and typographers** interested in lorem ipsum's history
- **Anyone curious about** consciousness, testimony, and the ethics of language
